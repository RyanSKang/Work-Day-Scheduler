## Description
Creating a simple work day schedule was a lot of fun and more reassuring that I wasn't completely lost in the course! We were given a starter code with pre-set CSS and Index HTML, and with that information we had to use Jquery within our JavaScript to present a functional schedule. We used Day.js in order to present our current Day and hour. The goal of this project was to allow our text within the text area of each time slot have the ability to be saved and posted after refreshing the page. we used Jquery syntax in order achieve our goals of saving our data into our local storage and displaying the text within our scheduler through functions after clicking the save button. Moreover, this project was interesting and different because I wasn't creating variables in my JS through document.query selectors or createElementByID, but setting my variables within the class and ID using parents|siblings|and calling attributes. I see why we had to do it this way because there were numerous divs|containers that we want to affect (color code by past present and future) with the least amount of code, while keeping the functionality.
I am still utilizing CSS to personalize my projects in a way to look different and more expressive. It helps rejog my memory in how to do things I learned in previous sections in the course. I still comment out and pseudo code my plan because it helps me break the project into parts and really hammer out the fine details.
